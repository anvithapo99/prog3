/*Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
Students have become secret admirers of SEGP. They find the course exciting and the professors amusing. After a superb Mid Semester examination, it’s now time for the results. The TAs have released the marks of students in the form of an array, where arr[i] represents the marks of the ith student.
Since you are a curious kid, you want to find all the marks that are not smaller than those on its right side in the array.*/
